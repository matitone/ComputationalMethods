The basics of how text files are encoded on computational devices will be discussed, as well as common methods for manipulating these files, extracting their contents, and converting between formats. In addition, modern tools and algorithms for indexation and search, including regular expression grammars and databases, will be covered. Students will learn how to train some common tools (e.g., concordances, indices, part of speech taggers, chunkers, and parsers) in a variety of languages. The tools, methods, and metrics of modern annotation in computational linguistics will be discussed in considerable depth, including the mechanisms for crowdsourced annotation. After completing this course, students will be able to construct simple programs in Python and Javascript. No background in programming or UNIX will be assumed.\r\n\r\nThis github repo has sections for:\r\n\r\n* classNotes\r\n* logistical information (see the [144 syllabus](https://github.com/panand/ComputationalMethods/blob/master/logistics/syllabus144.pdf) and [244 syllabus](https://github.com/panand/ComputationalMethods/blob/master/logistics/syllabus244.pdf) here)\r\n* scripts\r\n* [external resources](https://github.com/panand/ComputationalMethods/blob/master/externalResources.md)\r\n* [need help setting things up?](https://github.com/panand/ComputationalMethods/blob/master/logistics/)\r\n\r\nLogistics\r\n---------\r\n\r\nPranav Anand\r\npanand@ucsc.edu\r\n\r\nOliver Northrup\r\nnorthrup@ucsc.edu\r\n\r\nClass: Cowell 134, MW 17.00-18.45\r\nSection: [Crown Mac Lab](http://its.ucsc.edu/computer-labs/descriptions/crown.html), T 12.00-13.10, 16.00-17.10\r\n\r\nPranav's Office Hours: Stevenson 260, W 15.30-16.30  \r\nOliver's Office Hours: Stevenson 223, M 15.30-16.30\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
